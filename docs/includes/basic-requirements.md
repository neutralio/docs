> **Pip**<br />
>    Pip is a package management system built for software written in Python. It already comes with Python3 >= 3.4, but it's a good bet you will need to update to the most recent version.<br />
>    Update to the most recent version here: [pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

> **Git**<br />
>    Git is a fast, scalable, distributed version-control system with a rich command set that the nio System Designer relies on for adding and updating blocks as part of your nio instance.<br />
>    Follow this [installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get started with Git.
