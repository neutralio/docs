# nio CLI

The nio CLI is a tool that simplifies many of the tasks needed to work with a local nio instance. This tool is included with your installed nio binary. The nio CLI is the primary tool for creating new nio projects, adding blocks to an existing project, and listing information about a running nio instance.

To get started with the CLI create a new nio project using:
```bash
nio new [your project name]
```

Adding blocks to your project is a simple as using:
```bash
nio add [block name]
```

This section outlines all of the available CLI commands that would be beneficial when running nio locally.
