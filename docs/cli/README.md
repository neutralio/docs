# nio CLI

The nio command line interface (CLI) is a tool that simplifies many of the tasks needed to work with a local nio instance. This tool is included with your installed nio binary. The nio CLI is the primary tool for creating new nio projects, adding blocks to an existing project, and listing information about a running nio instance.

---

## Create a new project

```bash
nio new [your project name]
```

---

## Add blocks to your project:

```bash
nio add [block name]
```

This section outlines all of the available CLI commands that can be used when running the nio Platform locally.
