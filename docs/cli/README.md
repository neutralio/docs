# nio CLI

The nio command line interface (CLI) is a tool that simplifies many of the tasks needed to work with a local nio instance. This tool is included with your installed nio binary. The nio CLI is the primary tool for creating new nio projects, adding blocks to an existing project, and listing information about a running nio instance.

## [Create a new project](new.md)
