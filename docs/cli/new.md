# New Project

The `new` command creates a fresh project from the official [project template](https;//github.com/niolabs/project_template) repository. This command will run through the steps of cloning the project, updating all block submodules, and set the initial commit for your project. The new project folder will be made inside the current directory.

Example:
```bash
nio new first_project
```
Will create a new folder in your current directory named `first_project` containing everything needed for your nio project.
