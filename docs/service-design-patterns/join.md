# Restructure lists of signals

If you have a list of signals that you want to condense into fewer signals or even one signal, there are a few nio Blocks that will help. The [_Join_](https://blocks.n.io/Join) block is commonly used and supports [signal grouping](https://docs.n.io/service-design-patterns/group_by.html).

## Paring down lists of signals with the _<span class="allow-caps">Join</span>_ block

The _Join_ block goes through every signal in an incoming list and consolidates them into a single signal based on the specified criteria. For example, if you have your signal with the numbers 1 through 5 from the previous example, you can shrink the list of five signals into one signal containing two attributesâ€”one for odds and one for evens.
```
{
  "name": "Split Odds and Evens",
  "type": "Join",
  "key": "{{ $num % 2 }}",
  "value": "{{ $num }}"
}
```

This configuration (based on the configuration of **key**) will create a new signal with two attributes.
```
{
  0: [2, 4],
  1: [1, 3, 5]
}
```
