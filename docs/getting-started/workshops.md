# Workshops

There’s no “right way” to learn how to use the nio Platform. With nearly unlimited applications and wide-ranging skill sets, everyone can and should take a slightly different approach.  

While the more technical users may dive right into the nio System Designer and teach themselves with the aid of the documentation, we have created workshops for users looking for a guided learning experience. Workshop topics include:  
 - how to use the System Designer
 - exploring nio-in-action with a real world use case
 - learning fundamental concepts of building with nio in [nio 101](https://workshops.n.io/nio-101/)

Ready to jump in and start creating? Head over to workshops at [https://workshops.n.io/](https://workshops.n.io/) and start with the first tutorial.
