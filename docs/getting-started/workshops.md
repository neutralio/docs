# Workshops

While each of us contributes uniquely to the infinitely complex tapestry of the human experience, you probably fall into one of two groups for the purposes of learning how to use **nio**.

**Technical users** can dive right in:
* Log into the nio [System Designer](https://designer.n.io)
* Read the [documentation](https://docs.n.io)
* Check out the [block library](https://blocks.n.io)
* Master intra-instance communication with [Pubkeeper](https://docs.pubkeeper.com)

**Everyone else** (including those seeking a more guided learning experience) can:
* Get acquainted with [the basic architecture of a nio system](https://workshops.n.io/)
* Walk though the seven [nio 101 workshops](https://workshops.n.io/nio-101/)
* Install and run a pre-built service where you [try and keep a thirsty plant happy](https://workshops.n.io/plant_demo/)
