# Getting Started

There’s no “right way” to learn how to use the nio Platform. With nearly unlimited applications and wide-ranging skill sets, everyone can and should take a slightly different approach.  

## First Timer? Check out our workshops

We have created workshops for users looking for a guided learning experience. Workshop topics include:  
 - how to use the System Designer
 - exploring nio-in-action with a real world use case
 - learning fundamental concepts of building with nio in [nio 101](https://workshops.n.io/nio-101/)

Ready to jump in and start creating? Check out the workshops at [https://workshops.n.io](https://workshops.n.io/) and start with the first tutorial.

## Feeling Ambitious? Dive right in

If you want to just start using nio on your own, you can log in to the [https://designer.n.io](System Designer) to get started. There you can [create a managed cloud instance](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.md) or [install nio locally](/running-nio/locally.md).
