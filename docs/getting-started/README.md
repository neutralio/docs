# Getting Started

There’s no “right way” to learn how to use the nio Platform. With nearly unlimited applications and wide-ranging skill sets, everyone can and should take a slightly different approach.

We have created workshops for users looking for a guided learning experience. Going through the workshops will help you do the following:  
* Get acquainted with [the basic architecture of a nio system](https://workshops.n.io/)
* Walk though the seven [nio 101 workshops](https://workshops.n.io/nio-101/)
* Install and run a pre-built service where you [try and keep a thirsty plant happy](http://workshops.n.io/distributed-demonstration/virtual.html)
