# Create a Project

Now that the nio binary is installed, the next step is to create a nio project. A project folder is a way to organize and maintain the blocks, variables, and configurations that you will use in an instance of nio. Using the nio CLI is the easiest way to create a new nio project.

## Create a new nio Project Using the nio CLI
To create a project template using the CLI, enter the following command:

`nio new first_project`

This will create a `first_project` directory in your working directory that contains your nio project.
