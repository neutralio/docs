# Self-Managed and nio-Managed Instances

The nio System Designer works with both nio-managed (cloud) and self-managed (local) nio instances.

---
## nio Managed
nio-managed cloud instances are a quick, headache-free way for users to spin up a nio instance and quickly start building. They run in containers with up to 512MB of RAM hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.

---
## Self Managed
Self-managed instances allow users to download and install nio binaries throughout their systems. This provides the flexibility to distribute nio as needed in their solution. Users also maintain control of their data and services.

The number of available nio-managed and self-managed instances will differ depending on your plan. If you would like to increase your number of available instances, contact nio sales at [sales@niolabs.com](mailto:sales@niolabs.com).
