# Self-managed and nio-managed instances

The nio System Designer works with both nio-managed (cloud) and self-managed (local) nio instances.

---
## nio-managed
nio-managed cloud instances are a quick, headache-free way for users to spin up a nio instance and quickly start building. They run in containers with up to 512MB of RAM hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.

---
## Self-managed
Self-managed instances allow users to download and install nio binaries throughout their systems. This provides the flexibility to distribute nio as needed in a solution. Users also maintain control of their data and services.

The number of available nio-managed and self-managed instances will differ depending on your license. If you would like to increase your number of available instances, contact nio sales at [sales@niolabs.com](mailto:sales@niolabs.com).
