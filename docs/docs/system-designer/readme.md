# System Designer Overview

The System Designer is the graphical user interface used to build your n.io system. Note that your screen may look slightly different as changes are made to the interface.

&lt;The current image is a place holder for the actual screen capture. Lilly is updating the text for the images and then waiting for the screen to include the block library for the final screen capture. &gt;

## System

A list of systems is displayed in a column on the left side of the screen. The designer automatically creates an abbreviation for each system name.
