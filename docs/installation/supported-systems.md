# Supported Systems

nio requires a few basic dependencies for local installation.

---
### System Requirements

* **Python version 3.4+**<br />
    Visit the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download python.

* **Pip**<br />
    Pip is a package management system built for software written in Python. It already comes with Python3 >= 3.4, but it's a good bet you will need to update to the most recent version.<br />
    To update to the most recent version, go [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

* **Git**<br />
    Git is a fast, scalable, distributed version control system with a rich command set that the nio System Designer relies on for adding and updating blocks as part of your nio instance.<br />
    Follow this [installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get started with Git.

### Operating System

* **Linux** (with Kernel 3.0 or above & GCC)<br />
    If using a Linux OS, we recommend using a distribution that includes a modern kernel (Version 3.0 or above), with GCC and a package manager (like apt) pre-installed. This expedites the installation/setup process for our Python binary.

* **Raspbian** (Raspberry Pi)<br />
    For more information on our automated nio installation for the Raspberry Pi 3 or Raspberry Pi Zero, check out this [helpful blog](https://niolabs.com/blog/baking-nio-into-a-raspberry-pi).

* **MacOS** (Version 10.9 (Maverick) or above)<br />
