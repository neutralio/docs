# Install nio locally

You do not need to install nio to build systems in the the System Designer—running nio in [the cloud](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.md) is the easiest way to begin. But to see the power of nio as a distributed system, you should install and run nio locally or at the edge.


## Operating System

Choose one of the following supported systems:

[Windows](windows.md)<br>
(7–10, Server 2008–2012)

[Linux](linux.md)<br>
(with Kernel 3.0 or above & GCC)

[Raspbian](rasp.md)<br>
(Raspberry Pi)

[MacOS](mac.md)<br>
(Version 10.9, Maverick, or above)
For installation instructions, [click here](/installation/README.md).

The nio Platform requires a few basic dependencies for local installation.
