# Custom Blocks

The sky's the limit. If you want to connect to a new framework, library, or custom piece of hardware not currently included in the NIO-blocks collection, you can develop your own custom block.

The basic block philosophy is that one block should do one thing very well. If the piece of functionality you desire is not yet available, it is not difficult to create it yourself.
