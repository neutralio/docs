# Custom Blocks

If you want to connect to a new framework, library, or custom piece of hardware that is not currently included in the NIO-blocks collection, you can develop your own custom block.

The basic block philosophy is that a block should do one thing very well. If that one piece of functionality you desire is not yet available, it is not difficult to create it yourself.
