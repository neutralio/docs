# Blocks

Blocks are the units of {{ book.product }} that do the work to send, receive, and process signals. What makes a block a block?

A block has a **lifecycle** and at least one **input** terminal or one **output** terminal. Inside the block are optional **properties** which allow the block to be configured. Finally, a block has the potential to accept **commands** from the block REST API.

In sum, a {{ book.product }} block is:
- a unit of functionality that runs in a service
- "runnable"â€”meaning it goes through the six stages of the block life cycle: configuring, configured, starting, started, stopping, stopped, (error)
- a functional piece of code that receives streaming input signals and/or emits streaming output signals
- commandable through the block REST API
- a Python class that inherits from `nio.block.base.Block`


## Properties

Properties are the configuration fields of a block.

In the System Designer, the block's properties are the fields that appear in the configuration panel. Properties can include rules about how the block should process signals.

## Inputs/Outputs

A block's inputs and outputs are the terminals that receive or send signals and allow interblock interaction. In the System Designer you can connect blocks and allow signals to flow via a block's input and output terminals.

Signals are implemented as a collection of key-value pairs. Signals are always passed between blocks inside of a list. Learn more about signals [here](/service-design-patterns/understanding-signals.md)

## Commands

Commands allow a user to interact with a running instance of a block. This can be useful if a block maintains some internal state and a user wishes to inspect that state. When developing a block, you can make certain methods in your block class exposable as commands. That allows users to run functions inside the instance of your block from the System Designer.
