Click the **Teams** tab in the left navigation to navigate to the teams page. From the teams page you can create teams, view all the teams in the organization, and navigate to each team's page.

## Create a Team
If you are an organizer or owner of an organization, you can create a team. Creating teams is beneficial when you want to share a system from the System Designer with a group of users instead of sharing the same system with each user individually. On the teams page, enter a team name and click **add** to create a team.

If you are a collaborator, you can view teams but you are not able to create teams or modify the members of a team.

## Team Page
If you have created teams, you can click any team card to navigate to that team's page. From the team page, you can add an image to represent the team, modify the team name, add or remove team members, and remove the team from the organization.
