# Teams

Click the **Teams** tab in the left navigation to navigate to the teams page. From the teams page you can create teams, view all the teams in the organization, and navigate to each team's page.

## Create a Team
If you are an organizer or owner of an organization, you can create teams. Creating teams is beneficial when you want to share a system from the System Designer with a group of users instead of sharing the same system with each user individually. On the teams page, enter a team name and click **add** to create a team. (insert image)

If you are a collaborator, you can view teams but you are not able to create teams or modify the members of a team.

## Team Page
If you have created teams, you can click any team card to navigate to that team's page. From the team page, you can add an image to represent the team, modify the team name, add or remove team members, and remove the team from the organization.

### Modify Team Name
To update the team name, simply enter a new name in the form field and click the blue button to update.

### Add Team Image
To add an image that represents your team, click the circle next to the team name and upload an image (jpg, png, bmp, or gif file under 1MB) from your computer.

### Add Users to a Team
To add users to a team, navigate to the bottom of the team page, find the user that you want to add, and click the **add to team** button in the top right corner of the user card.  (insert image)
After you have added a user to a team, an icon will appear in the team card to show which users are members of the team. This icon also acts as a link to the user's profile page. (insert gif)

### Remove Users from a Team
To remove a user from the team, find the user's card on the team page. Click the blue **remove from team** button.

### Remove a Team from the Organization
To remove a team from your organization, click the red text link in the top right corner of the team page. You will be prompted with a pop-up modal to confirm that you actually want to remove the team from the organization. (insert image)
