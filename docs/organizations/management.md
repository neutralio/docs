Each user in an organization can have one of three roles: owner, organizer, or collaborator.

### Owner
There is only one owner and the owner has complete administrative access to the organization. The owner role is limited to the person who originally set up the Enterprise or OEM plan.

The owner is able to invite users at two different permission levels: organizer or collaborator.

Each permission level comes with the following abilities:

| | Create Organizations | Create Teams | Add Users | Share Systems | Manage Plan |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Owner** | ![](/img/icons/checkmark-green.svg) | ![](/img/icons/checkmark-green.svg) | ![](/img/icons/checkmark-green.svg) | ![](/img/icons/checkmark-green.svg) | ![](/img/icons/checkmark-green.svg) |

### Organizer
Organizers can add users, create teams, and manage the permission levels of users and teams. The main difference between the owner and an organizer is that the owner has access to the billing information of the organization.

### Collaborator
Collaborators can view users and teams but are not be able to add users or manage teams. Collaborators can only see systems that have been shared with them in the nio System Designer.
