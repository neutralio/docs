## Upgrade Plan

Whether you are a Sandbox, Enterprise, or OEM user, you have several options to upgrade your plan.

### Update Sandbox Billing Cycle
If you signed up for the Sandbox plan, you were presented with two payment options. If you selected to pay monthly and would prefer to pay a full year in advance with a discount, toggle to the **annually** option and click **update plan**. A modal will pop up asking you to confirm. Click **update license** to confirm or **cancel** if you want to keep your current billing cycle.

To upgrade to an Enterprise or OEM plan, click the button or text link that says **contact us** and fill out and submit your inquiry. We will get back to you shortly to discuss additional plan options.

### Upgrade Enterprise or OEM Plan
If you have outgrown your Enterprise or OEM plan, you can upgrade to a more robust plan by contacting us. From your plan page, click the button or text link that says **contact us** and fill out and submit your inquiry. We will get back to you shortly to discuss additional plan options.
