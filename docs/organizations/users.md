Click the **Users** tab in the left navigation to navigate to the users page. From the users page, owners and organizers can invite users to the organization, view each user and their status, and navigate to each user's profile page.

Collaborators can view users and user profiles but can not make any changes.

## Invite users to an organization

If you are an owner or a collaborator, you can invite anyone to become a member of your organization by sending them an email invitation.

If you want to invite multiple users with the same [permission level](/organizations/management.md), separate the email addresses with commas to bulk-send invites to multiple users.

## Status of users: invited or active
Users that have been invited but have not yet set up an account will have a gold circle next to their photos.

If you want to remind someone to set up an account, from the users page, find the user's card and hover over the three dots in the top right corner. Click **resend** to send a follow-up email invite.

You may also revoke an invitation from the same drop-down menu. If you no longer wish to invite the user to be a part of your organization, click **remove**.

Users that have been invited and have set up accounts will have a green circle next to their photo indicating that they are active within your organization.

If you are an owner or an organizer in the organization, you can update permission levels, assign users to teams, or remove the user from the organization.

If you are a collaborator in the organization, you can see profile pages, but you cannot make any changes.

### Updating the permission level of a user
To update the permission level of the user, from the user's profile page, simply change the radio button beneath the user’s name. To see more detailed information about permission levels, see [organization management](/organizations/management.md).

### Add a user to a team
While on a user’s profile page, you can quickly add the user to existing teams at the bottom of the page.

After you have added the user to a team, an icon will appear in the user’s card to show which team(s) that user is on. This icon also acts as a link to the team profile page.

### Remove a user from a team
The “Current Teams” section on a user’s profile page shows all of the teams a user belongs to. To remove the user from a team, click the blue button in the top right corner of the team card.

### Remove a user from an organization
To remove a user from your organization, go to the user's profile page. In the top right corner of the user’s profile, click the red text link. You will be prompted with a pop up modal to confirm that you want to remove the user from the organization.

## Linking accounts

If you sign up for a nio account with an email and a password and then try to use social sign on (i.e., Sign on with Google) with the same email, you will notice that they are technically different accounts with different nio systems and instances. There is no automatic way to link your email/password and social sign on accounts at this time. If you would like to link your accounts together so you can use either sign on mechanism then please contact support and we can take care of that for you.
