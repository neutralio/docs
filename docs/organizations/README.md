Building and maintaining enterprise-grade distributed systems is often a collaborative effort. Systems span IT-OT boundaries. IT administrators must maintain security and proper controls of data and assets. Operations personnel can be valuable contributors to system definition and creation. They should also seamlessly interact with the system on an ongoing basis.

The nio System Designer and nio Portal make it easy to manage [organizations](/organizations/management.md), [users](/organizations/users.md), [teams](/organizations/teams.md), and your [licensing plan](https://niolabs/licensing), so you can be a collaborative, effective digital organization.
