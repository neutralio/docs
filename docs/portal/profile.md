## Linking accounts

If you sign up for a nio account with an email and a password and then try to use social sign on (i.e., "log in with google") with the same email, you will notice that they are technically different accounts with different nio systems and instances. There is no automatic way to link your email/password and social sign-on accounts at this time. If you would like to link your accounts together so you can use either log in mechanism, then please contact support and we can take care of that for you.
