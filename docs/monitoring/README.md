# Monitoring

After deploying many software solutions, the task becomes monitoring them. With the nio Platform, it is easy to monitor the environment of nio instances. In many cases, this is not granular enough for your needsâ€“there is no visibility of the environment at the nio service level.

## Third party tools

If you are already using a third party monitoring solution and wish to monitor your nio deployment using that same tool, you have the ability to have nio report metrics to be visualized in your existing dashboards.

nio has blocks that integrate with [Google Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/) and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). To access guides on how to monitor nio with these third party tools, visit the following sections:
