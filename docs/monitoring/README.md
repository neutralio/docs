# Monitoring

After deploying a software solution, the task becomes monitoring it. With the nio Platform, it is easy to monitor the environment of nio instances. But in many cases, this is not granular enough for your needs because there is no visibility of the environment at the nio-service level.

To aid with this, the nio System Monitor is provided to organizations with commmercial licenses. This tool makes it easy to monitor the status of each instance within a system.
