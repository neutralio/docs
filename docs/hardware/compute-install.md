# Supported Systems

The standard nio binaries available with a license have a few basic dependencies for local installation.

For a quick start to running the nio Platform locally, please refer to our guide [here](/running-nio/locally.md).

More technical details about installing nio in various environments follow.

### System Requirements

#### Python version 3.4 and above

Visit the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download python.

#### Pip

Pip is a package management system built for software written in Python. It already comes with Python3 >= 3.4, but it's a good bet you will need to update to the most recent version.

To update to the most recent version, go [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

#### Git

Git is a fast, scalable, distributed version control system with a rich command set that the nio System Designer relies on for adding and updating blocks as part of your nio instance.

Follow this [installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get started with Git.

### Operating System
#### Linux

If using a Linux OS, we recommend using a distribution that includes a modern kernel (Version 3.0 or above), with GCC and a package manager (like apt) pre-installed. This expedites the installation/setup process for our Python binary.

**Dependencies**<br>Kernel 3.0 or above<br>GCC

#### Raspbian (Raspberry Pi)

#### MacOS

**Dependencies**<br>Version 10.9 (Maverick) or above
