# Supported Systems

The standard license nio binaries have some initial dependencies for full-functionality local installations.

For a quick start to nio running on a local instance, please refer to our guide [here](). <!-- TODO: add correct link here -->

For those that crave additional technical detail and background, check out [your available binaries]() and follow our guide below:

### System Requirements

#### Python version 3.4 and above

Visit the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download python.

#### Pip

Pip is a package management system built for software written in Python. It already comes with Python3 >= 3.4, but it's a good bet you'll need to update to the most recent version.

To update to the most recent version, go [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

#### Git

Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with a rich command set that the nio System Designer relies on for adding and updating blocks as part of your nio instance.

Follow this [installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get started with Git.

### Linux

If using a Linux OS, we recommend using a distribution that includes a modern kernel (Version 3.0 or above), with GCC and a package manager (like apt) pre-installed. This expedites the installation/setup process for our Python binary.

#### Dependencies

* Kernel 3.0 or above
* GCC

### Raspberry Pi Automated Installation

For more information on our automated nio installation for the Raspberry Pi 3 or Raspberry Pi Zero, check out this [helpful blog](https://niolabs.com/blog/baking-nio-into-a-raspberry-pi).

### MacOS

* Version 10.9 (Maverick) or above.
<!-- TODO: waiting on final install process -->

### Windows

* Windows 7-10
