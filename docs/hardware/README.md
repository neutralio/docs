# Recommended Hardware

You will realize the full potential of the nio Platform when you distribute it across multiple devices. We have architected nio with common challenges to interoperability and compatibility in mind.

nio is capable of running on all major operating systems (Linux, MacOS, and Windows) and a majority of available hardware systems. This includes edge nodes, cloud instances, and everything in between.

For lightweight edge nodes to use with the nio Platform, try some of the following:

* [Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13826)
* [Raspberry Pi Sense HAT](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-sense-hat/)
