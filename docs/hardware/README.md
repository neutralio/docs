# Hardware

You won't realize the full potential of nio until you distribute it throughout your system, so we have architected nio with common interoperability and compatibility challenges at front of mind.

nio is capable of running on all major operating systems (Linux, MacOS, and Windows) and a majority of available hardware systems. This covers edge nodes, cloud instances, and everything in between.

This section outlines the [nio binaries](/binaries/README.md), [supported systems](/hardware/compute-install.html), and [hardware kits](/hardware/kits-sensors.html) to get you building distributed systems with nio quickly.
