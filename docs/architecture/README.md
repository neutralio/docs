# Architecting a nio Solution

nio is a platform for building real-world, innovative, and impactful solutions.

Every state, every change, and every interaction in our world is a signal—from the percentage of moisture in the soil beneath your feet, to the vibration of your car motor, to the individual characters within your last tweet. Every _thing_ is producing context that already has, or will soon, become digitally available in the Internet of Things era. But how can these trillions of disparate signals work harmoniously to produce any meaningful value?

The nio Platform was built to act as the nervous system for a world with trillions of unique signals. It  allows you to create real-world, innovative, and impactful solutions with connected, distributed systems.

We’ve built solutions for [agriculture](https://niolabs.com/case-studies/agriculture), [machine learning](https://niolabs.com/case-studies/industrial), [enterprise IT](https://niolabs.com/case-studies/case-study-real-time-database-migration), [smart toys](https://niolabs.com/case-studies/raspberry-pi-car), and [industrial operations](https://niolabs.com/case-studies/case-study-industrial-operations-intelligence). We can’t wait to see what you build!
