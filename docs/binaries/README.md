# nio Binaries

The nio Platform architecture is extensible and modular. It can be sized and repackaged with different standard components specified for your use case and technology stack. nio can also be built to run with different programming languages and in different runtimes.

We call each packaged version of nio a binary. A nio binary consists of the nio [core](/binaries/core.md) and various [modules](/binaries/modules.md) and [components](/binaries/components.md). The list of available binaries for your licensing plan can be found [here](https://app.n.io/binaries/download).

If you are an enterprise or OEM customer with interest in an optimized nio binary, please reach out to the Enterprise Support Team at [enterprise@niolabs.com](mailto:enterprise@niolabs.com) to learn more.
