# Getting Started

n.io is a highly scalable stream processing engine. It allows you to asynchronously process streaming data signals and act on them in real time. n.io is the 'brains' of your real-time application, particularly systems that require distributed processing.

Here are a few sample use cases that n.io could be used for:

* You want to know what people are saying about your company on Twitter. Instantaneously get tweets that mention your business, automate responses, and identify trends. You can even alert your support team when the number of "help me" tweets pass your acceptable threshold.
* You run a factory and want to measure equipment performance and maintenance factors. To optimize the business processes and reduce downtime,  n.io can read the signal from any sensor and act on that data in real time. 

In this getting started tutorial you will learn how to get n.io up and running, create a project and build a simple service.
