# Getting Started

nio is a highly-scalable stream processing engine that allows you to asynchronously process streaming data signals and act on them in real time. nio is the brain of your real-time application, particularly systems that require distributed processing.

Here are a few sample use cases for nio:

* You want to know what people are posting about your company on Twitter. You can instantaneously receive notifications when tweets mention your business, automate responses, and identify trends are received. You can even alert your support team when the number of "help me" tweets passes your acceptable threshold.
* You run a factory and want to measure equipment performance and maintenance factors. To optimize the business processes and reduce downtime,  nio can read the signal from any sensor and act on the data in real time.

In this getting started tutorial you will learn how to get nio up and running before you proceed to the tutorials.
