# Getting Started

n.io is a highly scalable stream processing engine. It allows you to asynchronously process streaming data signals and act on them in real-time. It is generally used as the 'brains' of a real-time application, particularly systems that require distributed processing.

Here are a few sample use-cases that n.io could be used for:

* You want to know what people are saying about you on Twitter. Instantaneously get tweets that mention your business, automate responses, identify trends and alert your support team when the number of "help me" tweets pass your acceptable threshold.
* You run a factory and want to optimize workers and the end product. n.io can read from any sensor and act on that data in real-time.

In this getting started tutorial you will learn how to get n.io up and running, create a project and build a simple service.
