# Running {{ book.product }} in the Cloud

The easiest way to run {{ book.product }} is by running it in the cloud.

## Add a Cloud Instance

To create a cloud instance:

1. Log in to the System Designer.
2. Click the **+** button in the lower-left corner to create and name a new system.
3. Select the name of the system.
4. Select **Auto** for the Pubkeeper configuration.
5. Click **Accept**.
6. Click **Create a Cloud Instance**.
7. Type the name of the instance, leave the instance type as **n.io Cloud**, and click **Accept**.
8. Wait for the instance to spin up and note the name of the new instance on the left side.

## Add a Service

You now have an instance, but it is empty. Let's fix that!

To add a service:

1. Select the name of the instance.
2. Click **Add New Service**.
3. Type the name of the service, leave the service type as **Service**, and click **Accept**.

## Add A Block

You now have an empty canvas, and now you are ready for blocks.

nio blocks are installed to instances using the Block Library. The collection of blocks created by {{ book.product }} is also stored in the [Block Library at blocks.n.io](https://blocks.n.io/). You can search for blocks in the System Designer or in the Block Library.

To add a block:

1. Click the **Block Library** in the upper-right corner.
2. In the Search box, enter the name of a block. As you type, the list is filtered.
3. If the block is not displayed, click **Available**, **Installed**, and **Configured** to search for the block.
3. If the block is not already pre-installed, click the **Install Block** button which resembles a cloud with a down arrow.
3. Drag the block onto the canvas.
5. Type the name of the block and click **Accept**.
