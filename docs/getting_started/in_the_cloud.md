# Running {{ book.product }} in the Cloud

  https://designer.n.io/

1. Complete the **Create new system** window:
  * In the **System name** box, enter your system name.

## Add Blocks
You now have an empty canvas, and now you are ready for blocks.

nio blocks are installed to instances using the Block Library. The collection of blocks created by {{ book.product }} is also stored in the [Block Library at blocks.n.io](https://blocks.n.io/). You can search for blocks in the System Designer or in the Block Library.

1. Select the service by clicking the service name under the instance name in the left navigation panel or on the breadcrumb above the contextual toolbar.
1. In the **Block library** search box, enter a search term.
* If the block is not displayed, click **Available**, **Installed**, and **Configured** to search for the block.
* If the block is not already pre-installed, click the **Install block** button which resembles a cloud with a down arrow.
1. Drag the block type to the canvas.
1. Name the block.
1. Click **Accept**.

Once you have {{ book.product }} running, you can create many different projects. To guide you through the process, view the tutorials at https://workshops.n.io/.
