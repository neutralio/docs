## How do you want to use nio?

**The quickest way to use nio is [in the cloud](/quickstart/README.md).** A nio-managed cloud system does not require any installation and comes with a [Pubkeeper server](/pubkeeper/README.md).

Most of the time, Pubkeeper runs invisibly in the background. However, for more customizable use cases, you can sign up for a license that includes a downloadable Pubkeeper server.

Here are some example configurations of nio and Pubkeeper ranked from simplest to the most customizable:

| nio Platform | Pubkeeper Server | use case | personal | commercial
|------| -----|  ----| -----| ----|
| [cloud](/quickstart/README.md) | cloud | [cloud applications](/quickstart/README.md) | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| [local](/installation/nio/README.md) | cloud | [distributed applications](/installation/nio/README.md) | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| local | [local](/installation/pubkeeper/README.md) | [enterprise applications](https://niolabs.com/enterprise) |  | ✔️ |
