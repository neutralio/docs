# Cloud Data

nio Sandbox plans do not include an managed cloud storage. In order to have your cloud instances store data in a managed cloud data environment, you will need to sign up for a managed cloud data provider.

We recommend signing up for a [Google Cloud Platform account]() <!-- TODO: get actual link --> and using their managed data solutions. As a Google Cloud Technology Partner, we often release new blocks and connections to GCP services.

Take a look through the Database blocks that are currently built [here](https://blocks.n.io/?category=Database) and reach out to support with any questions about working with managed data partners.
