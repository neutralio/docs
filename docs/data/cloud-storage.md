# Cloud data

Most nio Platform licenses do not include managed cloud storage. In order to have your cloud instances store data in a managed cloud data environment, you will need to sign up for a managed cloud data provider.

We recommend signing up for a [Google Cloud Platform account](https://cloud.google.com/) and using their managed data solutions. As a Google Cloud Technology Partner, we often release new blocks and connections to GCP services.

Take a look through the nio [Database Blocks](https://blocks.n.io/?category=Database) that are currently built and reach out to support with any questions about working with managed data partners.
