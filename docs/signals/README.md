# Signals

Signals are what make your nio systems go. They can be generated by hardware, software, or humans, and should be a fundamental consideration when designing with nio.

```json
{
  "datetime": "2017-09-02T10:00:00-04:00",
  "soil_moisture": "67",
  "relative_humidity": "33",
  "above_canopy_temp": "89",
  "below_canopy_temp": "78",
  "vine_id": "112n5os23520595136981387krh23"
}
```

Signals are the events that trigger blocks to do their work and each signal contains information for the block to process. The block takes an incoming signal, performs its task—such as making an API call, adding some new information, transforming existing information, or doing a calculation—and then emits an outgoing signal as a new event. Signals follow paths and form streams.
