# Run nio

nio facilitates the creation of distributed computing solutions across an almost unlimited array of platforms and devices. As such, there are lots of ways for you to run nio. We've outlined some of the most common implementations below.

---
**Run nio**

* [In a nio-Managed Cloud](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.md): we run nio for you, and you build cloud-based solutions
* [Locally](/running-nio/locally.md): you run nio wherever you want, and use the System Designer to build and administer it
* [In a Docker Container](/running-nio/docker.md): containerize nio, and run it using Kubernetes or something like it
* [For a Long Time](/running-nio/long-running.md): you run nio in the background, and need it to be fault-tolerant
