# Run nio

The nio Platform facilitates the creation of distributed computing solutions across an almost unlimited array of platforms and devices.

nio is the core signal processor and works together with the Pubkeeper communications broker to send signals across systems.

Most of the time, Pubkeeper runs invisibly in the background and you do not need to modify or install it. However, if your use case requires customization, you can sign up for a license that includes a downloadable Pubkeeper server.

Here are some possible configurations of nio and Pubkeeper.

| nio | Pubkeeper | use case |
|------| -----|  ----|
| cloud | cloud | simple applications |
| local | cloud | distributed applications |
| local | local | enterprise applications |

The quickest way to use nio is [in the cloud](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.md). Every nio-managed cloud system comes with a Pubkeeper server.

If you want to run [nio locally](/running-nio/locally.md), you can access your nio-managed Pubkeeper server.

For a [local Pubkeeper](/running-nio/local-pubkeeper.md) server, contact nio sales at [sales@niolabs.com](mailto:sales@niolabs.com).


---

* [In a nio-managed cloud](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.md): we run nio for you, and you use the nio System Designer to build cloud-based solutions.
* [Local nio](/running-nio/locally.md): you run nio wherever you want, and use the System Designer to build and administer it.
  * [Optional local Pubkeeper](/running-nio/local-pubkeeper.md): you run nio wherever you want, and use the System Designer to build and administer it.
* [In a Docker container](/running-nio/docker.md): containerize nio and use Kubernetes or some other Docker orchestration tool.
* [In production](/running-nio/long-running.md): you run nio in the background over a sustained time period, and need it to be fault tolerant.
