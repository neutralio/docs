# Run nio

The nio Platform facilitates the creation of distributed computing solutions across an almost unlimited array of platforms and devices.

nio is the core signal processor and works together with the Pubkeeper communications broker to send signals across systems.

**The quickest way to use nio is [in the cloud](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.md).** A nio-managed cloud system does not require any installation and comes with a Pubkeeper server.

Most of the time, Pubkeeper runs invisibly in the background. However, for more customizable use cases, you can sign up for a license that includes a downloadable Pubkeeper server.

Here are some example configurations of nio and Pubkeeper ranked from simplest to the most customizable:

| nio | Pubkeeper | use case |
|------| -----|  ----|
| [cloud](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.md) | cloud | cloud applications |
| [local](/running-nio/locally.md) | cloud | distributed applications |
| local | [local](/running-nio/local-pubkeeper.md) | enterprise applications |


If you want to run [nio locally](/running-nio/locally.md), you can [access your nio-managed Pubkeeper server](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.md#pk-credentials).

For a [local Pubkeeper](/running-nio/local-pubkeeper.md) server, contact nio sales at [sales@niolabs.com](mailto:sales@niolabs.com).

Follow each link to see instructions for your use case:

* [In a nio-managed cloud](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.md): we run nio for you, and you use the nio System Designer to build cloud-based solutions. This is easiest way to get started quickly.
* [Local nio](/running-nio/locally.md): you run nio wherever you want and use the System Designer to build and administer it.
  * [Optional local Pubkeeper](/running-nio/local-pubkeeper.md): you run nio connect to a Pubkeeper server on your local network.
* [In a Docker container](/running-nio/docker.md): containerize nio and use Kubernetes or some other Docker orchestration tool.
* [In production](/running-nio/long-running.md): you run nio in the background over a sustained period of time and need it to be fault tolerant.
