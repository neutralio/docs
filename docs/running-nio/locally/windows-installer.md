# Install with Windows Installer

>**[info] Prerequisites**

>* The nio binary executable file (`.exe`). You will need a license agreement.
>* A nio system with Pubkeeper configuration. A step-by-step on how to create one can be found [here](/running-nio/in-the-cloud.html).

If you are installing the nio Platform on a Windows machine, we have an installer to make the process easier on you. To download the executable, download the "windows installer" from our [downloads](https://app.n.io/binaries/download) page.

Double click the executable file from wherever it downloaded on your computer to see the following setup images.

The next window in the setup process asks for your Pubkeeper host and token. To find this within the nio System Designer, click your system's name on the left hand side of the System Designer and then click **edit** in the toolbar. This will bring up the edit system modal. Copy and paste your Pubkeeper configuration from that window into the installer window.

Other installers will popup into view when you click **Install** in the previous window.
