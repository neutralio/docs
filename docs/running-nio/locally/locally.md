# Running nio Locally

The cloud is an easy way to get the nio Platform up and running, but it doesn't fully capture the distributed power of nio. To see the power of nio as a distributed system, you should install and run nio on a local or edge node.

The simplest way to get nio running on a device other than a nio-managed cloud instance is to use a cloud-based [Pubkeeper](/pubkeeper/) server to handle communications. To set up a local instance, follow these steps:

* [Install Binary](/running-nio/locally/binary.md)
* [Create a Project](/running-nio/locally/project.md)
* [Run nio](/running-nio/locally/run-nio.md)
* [Add Instance](/running-nio/locally/add-instance.md)

If you require further customizations or are interested in how to configure the process manually, see the section [Manual Installation](/running-nio/locally/manual.md).
