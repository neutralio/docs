# System Templates

When creating a new system in the System Designer, users have the option of starting with either a blank system or a system template.

Using a system template launches a nio system with pre-configured functionality and development notes across instances, services, and blocks.

System templates are great for quickly learning new concepts and skills (we’ve built several [workshop templates](https://workshops.n.io/system-templates)) and/or jump starting your next production system.

Make sure to check out the available templates(https://workshops.n.io/system-templates) next time you launch a new system! We’re always adding to the library.

If you’ve built something that you think other nio users would enjoy and you want to share, give us a shout at [influencer@niolabs.com](mailto:influencer@niolabs.com)!
