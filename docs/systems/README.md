# Systems

Systems are defined as "sets of connected things that form a complex whole." nio systems are no different.

Just like your biological system is a group of organs working together to keep you alive, a nio system is a group of distributed nio instances, user interfaces, and a Pubkeeper broker/server working together to achieve a common goal.

Building digital distributed systems can be extraordinarily complex.  nio simplifies this by giving a common platform to listen, transform, share, and act upon signals regardless of where the instances live within the system (chip, gateway, or cloud).
